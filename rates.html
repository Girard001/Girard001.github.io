      <h2>Location Recording</h2>
      <p>
        Our rate for location recording is made up of three components: labor, equipment, and recording. A rate quote, tailored to the job, is provided when the job is booked. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Labor is based on an 8 hour full day, although other options are available (e.g., 10 hour days, portal-to-portal rates for work done outside the immediate DC area and, occasionally, half days for regular customers). Overtime is charged at 1.5 times the normal hourly rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The equipment charge covers a typical field production package, including mixer(s), boom microphone, body microphones, and the first 2 wireless systems. Additional wireless are available a la carte, as is a large inventory of specialized audio gear such as Comteks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no recording charge for jobs where the audio is recorded only on the camera (single system sound). Recordings can be made in WAV and/or MP3 formats, with or without time-code reference. Also, up to 12 individual tracks can be recorded. The charge for recording varies depending on the type selected. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Conferences and Events
      </h2>
      <p>
        The cost of a conference or event is made up of two components: labor and equipment. The labor rate is higher than that for location recording in order to cover the cost of pre-production planning, preparation of the equipment package, and re-stocking of the equipment after the job.  Overtime is charged at the same rate as for location recording. More complicated jobs will frequently have a half day of set up prior to the first day of the event.</p>

      <p>
        The equipment portion of the job cost is driven by the specifications for the event. For example, an event  requiring 12 wireless microphones, sound reinforcement  and a 12 track audio recording will cost substantially more than a 6 person panel discussion for which there is no audience, and the audio mix is recorded to a single camera.</p>

      <p>
        Once the timing of the event is known, and the specifications are understood, a budget is provided. This budget is the final price of the job, unless there are major changes to the scope of work before, or during, the event.</p>

      <h2>
        Audio Editing
      </h2>

      <p>
        There are two types of audio editing: audio only and mix-to-pix. There are different labor rates for each.

      <h2>Forensic Audio</h2>
      <p>
        While the tools and techniques employed to do forensic audio are similar to those used for the type of audio sweetening done in mix-to-pix editing, the work is much more  tedious. This is because the source material is usually of very poor quality. Therefore, the labor rate is higher than for mix-to-pix audio editing.

      <h2>Audio Measurement</h2>
      <p>
        There are 3 types of charges for audio measurement projects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            site visits and pre-production activities,
          </li>
          <li>
            measurement sessions, and
          </li>
          <li>
            analysis and report writing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Each of these charges are based on a different labor rate.
